# Map Printer
When installed reading the Cartography Table will also save a simplified (less busy) map to your computer's hard drive. This mod was designed to enhance no-map playthroughs by drawing a static map for players to look at that shows their exploration progress without the spoiler of live updates.

Works as a companion to a no-map mod to give Cartography Tables a fresh purpose, or as a standalone just to get an alternate map style. I don't judge.

## Compatibility:
* This mod interacts with very little of the game code, conflicts with other mods are pretty unlikely.

## Config File:
* Copy and paste which directory you want your saves to appear in. Leaving the field blank will save files to Valheim's screenshots folder.
* Choose which of four map types you want. Only "Chart" is enabled by default.

## Manual Install:
It's a BepInEx mod. Just drop the .dll into the BepInEx/plugins folder and you're good to go. Like all other BepInEx mods the config file gets generated the first time you run the game with the mod installed.

## Use:
I recommend using image editing software that supports layers. I put the output from this mod in the bottom layer and draw roads and markers on the layers above it. Then when I reprint my maps I just swap the bottom layer out with the new image. Works like a charm!
